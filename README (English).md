## About The Project

The indications for the project were as follows:
to develop a JavaScript application that allows the user to increase and decrease the value of the counter: as soon as you enter the page, 0 will be displayed as the value of the counter and you will have two buttons (+/-) to change the value of the counter.

Basics aside, I created the counter elements with Javascript by implementing them thanks to the document.createElement() method, capable of creating an HTML element from its tag name.

I decided to use three Javascript scripts to better divide my work:
- The first for the creation of the elements (elements.js).
- The second for their style (elements-style.js).
- The third for the increase and decrease functions (functions.js).

Not being able to give up making everything a little more pleasing to the eyes, I also used a CSS style sheet for the various HTML elements and images (created by me with Adobe Illustrator).

In the footer of the page I inserted the various links for the project repository, and for my personal profiles.

## Built With
- HTML 
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR (Logo Image)

## Usage
The counter works very simply: the + button adds one unit to the initial value (0).
Consequently the - button decreases the value by one unit (if the value is different from 0).
